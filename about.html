    <h2>About</h2>

    My name is Joel Svensson and I work for the swedish
    research institutes (RISE) within the area of dependable systems.
    This is however my personal webpage where I share my interests in a
    broader sense. <br><br>
    
    During 2019 I started
    making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoYew8-D8C9OHVzX2hQZikQ">youtube
      videos</a> (I know they are goofy but I hope improve as time goes
    by). I enjoy learning new things, and I want my videos to convey or
    illustrate that it is possible to "do things" even if you are not an
    expert in the area.  Currently I am having a lot of fun with
    electronics and making my own PCBs
    using <a href="https://kicad-pcb.org/"> KiCad </a>, something I
    thought would be completely impossible for someone who is not an
    electrical engineer.  I believe that if we all help each other out
    and share our experiences and learning efforts, we can all do fun
    and interesting stuff in areas we previously thought to be out of
    reach.  Most hardware design and code that I develop in the videos
    are released freely as open source so
    please <a href="http://www.github.com/svenssonjoel"> clone, modify
    and share </a>. <br>

    I think that is important to be aware of these things but I am not
    fundamentally against the concept. Google analytics for example help
    me by showing which pages that get reads. This information I can use
    to make more of that.
