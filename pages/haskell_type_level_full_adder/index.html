<h1 id="type-level-full-adder-in-haskell">Type Level Full-Adder in Haskell</h1>
<p>I haven't really done much Haskell programming for a couple of years. Recent changes in employment will make it more likely that I will be doing some Haskell programming from now on though. I have always felt like a "katt bland hermelinerna" (not quite fitting in "skunk at the garden party" or "fox in the hen-house" perhaps) in the Haskell community. Haskell is hard and messy and especially when there is too much "type-magic" I very easily get lost and confused. Don't get me wrong, the Haskell community is very friendly, just on average way more clever than I am.</p>
<p>What I am getting at is that I have absolutely no idea what I am doing in the code presented in this blog-post! But this is quite ok by me and totally in line with the goals of my blogging. I want to post about my work as unfiltered as possible to share my stupid mistakes and horrible misunderstandings. I hope there are the occasional useful bit of info as well of course! I also greatly appreciate any pointers I get from anyone reading. So thanks ;)</p>
<p>I got a really out-of-character urge today to see if I could implement a full-adder in Haskell types. From what I can tell it seems to work.</p>
<p>Two extensions are used for this experiment, <code>TypeFamilies</code> and <code>UndecidableInstances</code>. <code>UndecidableInstances</code> sounds really menacing, it apparently makes it possible end up with a non-terminating type-check. The <code>TypeFamilies</code> extension, as far as I understand, allows a limited form of function definition on the type-level.</p>
<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}
{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}
</code></pre>
<p>The data types <code>One</code> and <code>Zero</code> are the values that a "bit" can hold.</p>
<pre><code>data One
data Zero
</code></pre>
<p>Two type level functions <code>And</code> and <code>Or</code> implement the truth tables for the these operations over tuples of bits.</p>
<pre><code>type family And a
type instance And (Zero,  One) = Zero
type instance And (One,  Zero) = Zero
type instance And (One,   One) = One
type instance And (Zero, Zero) = Zero

type family Xor a
type instance Xor (Zero,  One) = One
type instance Xor (One,  Zero) = One
type instance Xor (One,   One) = Zero
type instance Xor (Zero, Zero) = Zero
</code></pre>
<p>A full-adder can be constructed by combining two so-called half adders. So the <code>HalfAdder</code> function implements this operation. To make sense, it should be applied to a tuple of bits (are there any ways of enforcing this nicely?) and it computes the sum of these bits and also computes a carry value. <code>Xor a</code> is the sum part and <code>And a</code> is the carry part.</p>
<pre><code>type family HalfAdder a
type instance HalfAdder a = (Xor a, And a)
</code></pre>
<p>So that part fell into place without to much trouble. So the next step is to combine two half adders and a bit of extra logic to form the full adder. Here I got very stuck. And the thing causing trouble is that you cannot partially apply the type family based type level functions (as I understand it) or pass them around unapplied. This <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50494228/type-family-as-argument-to-type-synonym">answer on stackoverflow</a> provided a way through this obstacle though.</p>
<p>A full adder takes three bits as input, call them a, b and carry-in, and outputs two bits called sum and carry-out. This way, many full adders can connected together to form multi-bit adders, so called ripple carry adders. For the full adder, two half adders and a single or gate is needed.</p>
<p>I started out with something like this. There needs to be half adder somewhere in there to compute the sum of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.</p>
<pre><code>type family FullAdder a
type instance FullAdder ((a,b),c) = ... (HalfAdder (a, b)) ... 
</code></pre>
<p>But after that it gets messy. Now one of the outputs of the half adder should be fed to another half adder together with <code>c</code>. So either the result of <code>HalfAdder (a, b)</code> should be "untupled" in some way and then one of the elements in that tuple should be "retupled" with <code>c</code> and fed to half adder number 2. This doesn't work!</p>
<p>So instead I thought it may be possible to express some operations over the result tuples..</p>
<pre><code>type family AppFst (f :: * -&gt; *) p
type instance AppFst f ((a, b), c) = (f (c, a), b)
</code></pre>
<p>Then change the full adder like this:</p>
<pre><code>type family FullAdder a
type instance FullAdder ((a,b),c) = ... AppFst HalfAdder ((HalfAdder (a,b)), c)
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn't work at all!</p>
<pre><code> error:
    • The type family ‘HalfAdder’ should have 1 argument, but has been given none
    • In the type instance declaration for ‘FullAdder’
</code></pre>
<p>This is where the fix from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50494228/type-family-as-argument-to-type-synonym">stackoverflow</a> comes in. It seems to not be possible to have <code>HalfAdder</code> unapplied in there like that, but it is possible to have a "tag" representing the half adder in there together with an extra <code>App</code> (for apply) type family that represents the application of one of these "tags".</p>
<pre><code>type family App (token :: *) a

data TokHalfAdd
data TokOr

type instance App TokHalfAdd a = HalfAdder a
type instance App TokOr a = Or a
</code></pre>
<p>The code above implements application of tags and the tags needed for the half adder and the or gate. The two type instances are a kind of evaluator for the tags.</p>
<p>Now the <code>AppFST</code> combinator can be restated like this:</p>
<pre><code>type family AppFST (f :: *) p
type instance AppFST f ((a, b), c) = (App f (c,a), b)
</code></pre>
<p>And a bit of progress can be made on the full adder.</p>
<pre><code>type family FullAdder a
type instance FullAdder ((a, b),c) = ... (AppFST TokHalfAdd ((HalfAdder (a,b)),c))
</code></pre>
<p>The last step is to or together the two carry bits and this means adding a <code>AppSND</code> combinator.</p>
<pre><code>type family AppSND (f :: *) p
type instance AppSND f ((a, b),c) = (a, App f (c,b))
</code></pre>
<p>And the full adder can be completed.</p>
<pre><code>type family FullAdder a
type instance FullAdder ((a, b),c) = AppSND TokOr (AppFST TokHalfAdd ((HalfAdder (a,b)),c))
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this seems to make it possible to "simulate" full adders in the Haskell type-checker. for example</p>
<pre><code>a1 :: FullAdder ((Zero, Zero), Zero)
a1 = undefined
</code></pre>
<p>The result of this addition should be (Zero, Zero), so let's ask GHCI.</p>
<pre><code>*Main&gt; :t a1
a1 :: (Zero, Zero)
</code></pre>
<p>Good, but not very interesting. Let's try some more:</p>
<pre><code>-- (One, Zero)
a2 :: FullAdder ((Zero, Zero), One)
a2 = undefined 

-- (one, Zero)
a3 :: FullAdder ((Zero, One), Zero)
a3 = undefined

-- (Zero, One)
a4 :: FullAdder ((Zero, One), One)
a4 = undefined 

-- (One, Zero)
a5 :: FullAdder ((One, Zero), Zero)
a5 = undefined 

-- (Zero, One)
a6 :: FullAdder ((One, Zero), One)
a6 = undefined 

-- (One, One)
a7 :: FullAdder ((One, One), One)
a7 = undefined 
</code></pre>
<p>And ask GHCI about these.</p>
<pre><code>*Main&gt; :t a2
a2 :: (One, Zero)
*Main&gt; :t a3
a3 :: (One, Zero)
*Main&gt; :t a4
a4 :: (Zero, One)
*Main&gt; :t a5
a5 :: (One, Zero)
*Main&gt; :t a6
a6 :: (Zero, One)
*Main&gt; :t a7
a7 :: (One, One)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Help! Does any of this make any sense?</p>
<p>This was lots of fun though! So I thought I'd share it ;)</p>
