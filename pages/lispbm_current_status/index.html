<h1 id="another-lisp-for-microcontrollers">Another Lisp for Microcontrollers</h1>
<p>For a while now, not too long, couple of years or so, I have been working in the vicinity of microcontrollers (MCUs). I don't have a whole lot of experience in low-level programming of devices like the <a href="https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32-discovery-kits.html">STM32</a> , the <a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Low-power-short-range-wireless/nRF52833/GetStarted">NRF52</a> or the ARM Cortex A9 of the Xilinx Zynq chip on the <a href="https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TE0726-03M-ZynqBerry-Module-with-Xilinx-Zynq-7010-in-Raspberry-Pi-Form-Faktor">Trenz ZynqBerry</a>. But I do enjoy learning about them, <strong>slowly</strong>. The Code in C, Cross-compile, Flash and Debug loop (CCFDL?) is a bit heavy though. Wouldn't it be nice with a REPL (Read, Evaluate and Print Loop)?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA&amp;list=PLE18841CABEA24090">MIT 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> series of lecturs is a lot of fun and I recommend everyone to watch it. I watched this lecture series several times while entertaining the idea of some day implement some kind of a Lisp. However, I didn't want to implement a Lisp interpreter in Lisp, or even in Haskell, it would feel a bit like cheating. So instead, the idea is to combine these two newly found interests (MCUs and Lips).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/svenssonjoel/lispBM">lispBM</a> project is my (ongoing) attempt to learn some about lisp while at the same time learn more about MCUs to make them more accessible to me, once you get used to having a REPL it is hard to go back.</p>
<p>I don't have very much experience or long background in programming numerous Lisps, so my attempt of making one is most likely very naive. A small amount of dabbling with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/">Emacs Lisp</a> and I did like skimming <a href="https://nostarch.com/lisp.htm">Land Of Lisp</a> but navigating the jungle of Lisp dialects is not where I am at. This means that lispBM is not going to adhere to any standard or be a real <em>Scheme</em> or <em>CL</em>, to me that does not matter!</p>
<p>Now I know that there are many other MCU-lisps. I have tried not to peek at the insides of these at all. But I looked at <a href="http://lisperator.net/pltut/">Lisperator</a> for some tips with the evaluator, I would definitely recommend this tutorial. I have probably stared at the tail-call optimizing evaulator at Lisperator for hours trying to understand what is going on there. I am not going to pretend that I fully understand it yet. Early on I used the <a href="https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc">MPC</a> Micro Parser Combinators for parsing expressions. This is the same parser generator code that is used in <a href="http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/">BuidYourOwnLisp</a>. However, when going towards smaller MCUs (with less than 256k or RAM) the MPC library showed to be a bit to hungry on memory and I had to hack something up (more about that in the section about parsing).</p>
<p>Here is a list of other Lisp-on-odd-hardware projects:</p>

</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are more examples! please let me know what you are working on.</p>
<p>If you want to see lispBM in action, check out the video <a href="https://youtu.be/OeQ161G_Kgs">LISPBM on NRF52</a> or the video that goes over what went into porting it to NRF52 <a href="https://youtu.be/cXSavxC3th0">LISPBM Porting to NRF52</a>.</p>
<p>LispBM is written in C, compiles with -std=c11 flag, for 32bit platforms. So far it has been tried out on x86 (with -m32 flag and depending on something like multilib if you are on a 64bit platform), ARM Cortex M4 (the STM32F4 MCU), ARM Cortex M4 (the NRF52 MCU) and ARM Cortex A9 (The Xilinx Zynq 7000). When deploying lispBM on an MCU it helps a lot to have access to a <em>Hardware Abstraction Layer</em>, HAL. So far lispBM has been compiled into code based on <a href="http://chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php">ChibiOs</a> and <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org/">ZephyrOs</a> both providing a lot of HAL functionality.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-thoughts-on-lisp">A Few Thoughts on Lisp</h2>
<p>The series of MIT video lectures showed a simple elegance and really made me want to try making some kind of a Lisp. If you just get over the strange "prefix" notation where <code>(+ 1 2)</code> means <code>(1 + 2)</code> and instead focus on the really cool part that <code>(+ 1 2)</code> is actually exactly what the expression looks like loaded into memory (the Lisp heap) and that it extends to <em>N</em> arguments <code>(+ 1 2 3 4)</code>. When I say that <code>(+ 1 2)</code> is exactly what it looks like in memory, what I mean is that it is stored as a linked list where the first element is the <em>symbol</em> <code>+</code> and the second and third elements of the list are the <em>values</em> <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. The elements and pointers to the next cell are stored in what is called <em>cons cells</em>. a cons cell consists of enough bytes of memory to hold two pointers or two values or some two element permutation of pointer and value (all the details of this as it is implemented in lispBM can be found later in this text). In more detail then, the expression <code>(+ 1 2)</code> will in memory be made up out of a first cons cell containing <code>+</code> in its first position (or car) and a pointed to the next cell in its second (cdr) position. Likewise, the next cell contains the <code>1</code> in the car position and a pointer to the next cell in the cdr. The last cell in the linked up structure of cons cells contains a <code>2</code> in car and a special symbol called <code>nil</code> in the cdr position to terminate the list.</p>
<p><img src="./media/cons_cell.png" title="Cons cell" alt="Cons cell" /></p>
<p>Now, if we give <code>(+ 1 2)</code> to a Lisp interpreter, it will evaluate it and arrive at the answer <code>3</code>. The first stage in this, though, is to read the string <code>(+ 1 2)</code> into the heap (generating the linked list of symbols and values), this is called <em>Reading</em>. Following that the lisp interpreter will start to consume the linked list to reduce it to an answer, called <em>evaluating</em>. Finally the result is <em>printed</em>. This is what a <em>REPL</em> does, it reads, evaluates and prints and then it does it all again.</p>
<p><img src="./media/read_eval0.png" title="Read and Evaluate" alt="Read evaluate" /></p>
<p>If giving the lisp interpreter a list (such as <code>(+ 1 2)</code>) it will be assumed to mean "add 1 and 2", so how does one actually create a list <em>of data</em>? Giving the list <code>(1 2 3)</code> to the interpreter will not work. The interpreter always treats a list given to it in this way as an application of the <em>function</em> represented by the first element to the rest of the elements. So doing that will give some kind of an error message. There is, However, an operator that tells the interpreter not to evaluate its argument, this operator is called <em>quote</em> and is written <code>'</code> as in for example <code>'(1 2 3)</code>. So when you give the expression <code>'(1 2 3)</code> to the REPL, it will reply with <code>(1 2 3)</code>. We have created a list. It is also possible to give the expression <code>'(+ 1 2)</code> to the REPL and this will result in a linked list in memory consisting of elements <code>+</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>2</code>. The REPL will now give <code>(+ 1 2)</code> as the output result of your computation. There is an operation with the reversed meaning as well called <code>eval</code> that means "do evaluate this". As an example the expression <code>(eval '(+ 1 2))</code> given to the REPL again results in it printing out the answer <code>3</code>. Together <code>'</code> and <code>eval</code> are very powerful, it means we can construct code <strong>on the fly</strong> in memory and then have the interpreter compute the result.</p>
<p><img src="./media/read_eval_quoted.png" title="Read and evaluate a quoted expression" alt="Read eval qouted" /></p>
<p>In the paragraphs above there are a couple of words that I emphasized without much explanation. These are words that (as I understand it) are part of the Lisp vocabulary. The heap consists of cons cells, only large enough to hold two pointers or values (or mix there-of) so a symbol (such as <code>+</code>) also has to be represented by a number no larger than a pointer in number of bits. This means that values (characters, signed or unsigned integers), symbols, pointers all can appear on either car or cdr part of a cell. To tell them apart a couple of bits are sacrificed. I will go into the details about this in the section about the heap below.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-the-lispbm-language-constructs">Introducing the LispBM Language constructs</h2>
<p>Before going into the implementation details, I want to give a few examples of lispBM code in order to introduce many of the concepts that we will see again in the following sections.</p>
<p>When starting up the example REPL from the lispBM github repository you see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Symrepr initialized.
Heap initialized. Heap size: 0.015625 MiB. Free cons cells: 2048
Evaluator initialized.
Extension added.
Lisp REPL started!
Type :quit to exit.
     :info for statistics.
# 
</code></pre>
<p>It shows a prompt where you can type in your lisp expressions or you can type <code>:info</code> for some statistics and information about the current state of the runtime system:</p>
<pre><code># :info
############################################################
Used cons cells: 402
ENV: ((foldl (closure ((f (i (xs nil))) ((if ((= (xs (nil nil))) ...
Allocated arrays: 0
GC counter: 0
Recovered: 0
Recovered arrays: 0
Marked: 0
Free cons cells: 1646
############################################################
#
</code></pre>
<p>This information will show how much of the heap is in use currently and how much is free, how many times garbage collection has been executed and so on. <code>ENV</code> refers to the contents of the environment that will be touched upon shortly in this section.</p>
<p>Now let's explore some of the basic functionality of this REPL.</p>
<h3 id="cons-car-and-cdr"><code>cons</code>, <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code></h3>
<p>The <code>cons</code> function is used to construct. What it constructs are cons cells.</p>
<pre><code># (cons 1 2)
&gt; (1 2)
</code></pre>
<p><code>cons</code> takes two arguments and returns a pair. Used like this, with two values, <code>cons</code> allocates a cons cell from the heap and puts the values in the car and cdr position of that cell. This is not the same as evaluating <code>'(1 2)</code></p>
<pre><code># &#39;(1 2)
&gt; (1 (2 nil))
</code></pre>
<p><img src="./media/cons_heap.png" title="Cons and heap representations" alt="Cons and heap representations" /></p>
<p>It is a little bit unfortunate that lispBM is printing the result of <code>(cons 1 2)</code> as <code>(1 2)</code>. As I understand it, it is common to print this heap structure as <code>(1 . 2)</code> and call it a dotted pair. LispBM does not recognize dotted pairs in reading or uses them in output, should add this to the todo-list.</p>
<p>The <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> functions break things apart.</p>
<pre><code># (car (cons 1 2))
&gt; 1
# (cdr (cons 1 2))
&gt; 2

</code></pre>
<p><img src="./media/car_cdr.png" title="Car and cdr" alt="Car and cdr" /></p>
<h3 id="if"><code>if</code></h3>
<p>The conditional <code>if</code> takes three arguments, the first should be something that evaluates to true <code>t</code> or <code>nil</code> for false. The next two arguments are the expressions to evaluate on the <em>then</em> or <em>else</em> branch.</p>
<pre><code># (if &#39;t 1 2)
&gt; 1
# (if &#39;nil 1 2)
&gt; 2
</code></pre>
<h3 id="define"><code>define</code></h3>
<p><code>define</code> is used to add things to a global environment.</p>
<pre><code># (define apa 1)
&gt; t
</code></pre>
<p>This function application adds an entry into the environment that states that <code>apa</code> is defined to <code>1</code>. Typing <code>:info</code> in the REPL should this mapping.</p>
<pre><code># :info
############################################################
Used cons cells: 547
ENV: ((apa 1) ((foldl (closure ((f (i (xs nil))) ((if ((= (xs (nil nil))) ...
Allocated arrays: 0
GC counter: 0
Recovered: 0
Recovered arrays: 0
Marked: 0
Free cons cells: 1501
############################################################

</code></pre>
<p>After defining <code>apa</code> to be 1 this is what it will evaluate to.</p>
<pre><code># apa
&gt; 1
# (+ 10 apa)
&gt; 11
#
</code></pre>
<h3 id="let"><code>let</code></h3>
<p><code>let</code> is used to bind a variable (symbol) to a value locally. It takes two arguments where the first is a list of bindings and the second is an expression which will be evaluated in an environment extended with those given bindings.</p>
<pre><code># (let ((a 10)) (+ a 1))
&gt; 11
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to set up more bindings with <code>let</code> it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code># (let ((a 10) (b 20) (c 30)) (+ a b c))
&gt; 60
</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to nest <code>let</code> bindings and locally override a binding:</p>
<pre><code># (let ((a 1)) (+ a (let ((a 10)) (+ a a))))
&gt; 21
</code></pre>
<p>Below is an example that shows that a local binding also overrides a global binding and that the global binding is left unchanged when leaving the local scope.</p>
<pre><code># (let ((apa 1000)) (+ apa 1))
&gt; 1001
# apa
&gt; 1
</code></pre>
<p>The form of <code>let</code> used in lispBM allows an earlier binding in the list of bindings to be used as part of computations in later bindings.</p>
<pre><code># (let ((g 1) (h (+ g 1000))) h)
&gt; 1001

</code></pre>
<h3 id="lambda-and-closure"><code>lambda</code> and <code>closure</code></h3>
<p>New functions are defined using <code>lambda</code> that takes two arguments a list of parameter names and an expression. Using <code>lambda</code> creates an anonymous function that can be either directly applied or bound to a name using either <code>define</code> or <code>let</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a directly applied anonymous function:</p>
<pre><code># ((lambda (x) (+ x x)) 2)
&gt; 4
</code></pre>
<p>That is a lot of parentheses and may be hard to read. Binding the anonymous function to a name may help a bit.</p>
<pre><code># (define f (lambda (x) (+ x x)))
&gt; t
# (f 2)
&gt; 4
# 
</code></pre>
<p>Evaluating the expression <code>(lambda (x) (+ x x))</code> results in a <code>closure</code>.</p>
<pre><code># (lambda (x) (+ x x))
&gt; (closure ((x nil) ((+ (x (x nil))) (nil nil))))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>closure</code> looks very similar to the original <code>lambda</code> except that it has one more parameter, an environment. When forming a <code>closure</code> any local bindings that are needed within the expression body of the lambda is sucked into this closure-local environment. This is what makes it possible for us to write functions that return functions. Here is an example of a closure with sucked-in values from the surrounding local scope:</p>
<pre><code># (let ((y 100)) (lambda (x) (+ x y)))
&gt; (closure ((x nil) ((+ (x (y nil))) (((y 100) nil) nil))))

</code></pre>
<p>Here we can see that the binding <code>(y 100)</code> is present in the <code>closure</code> object created.</p>
<h3 id="progn"><code>progn</code></h3>
<p>The <code>progn</code> primitive evaluates a sequence (an arbitrary number of) expressions for side-effects and finally returns the value of the last expression in the sequence as the final result.</p>
<pre><code># (progn (print &quot;Hello world&quot; \#newline) (+ 1 2))
Hello world
&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>print</code> function used in this example is an <em>extension</em>. Extensions are a way to add platform dependent functionality to lispBM. The target platforms have many different ways of dealing with this kind of IO so I don't want to build any expectations on existing methods of presenting text into lispBM itself. There are still a few calls to <code>printf</code> present in lispBM but removing these are on the todo-list.</p>
<h3 id="a-slightly-larger-example">A Slightly Larger Example</h3>
<p>Here is a larger example that makes combined use of many of the features introduced above. It is a function that computes the nth fibonacci number in a tail-recursive way. There will be more about tail-recursion in the section about the evaluator.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a>(define fib (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (n)</span>

<p>This example code evaluates to <code>55</code>.</p>
<p>With this example we conclude the walkthrough of some fundamental language constructs that can be used in lispBM programs. From now on this text will be mostly about how these things are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="heap-consisting-of-cons-cells">Heap Consisting of Cons cells</h2>
<p>The implementation of the heap is found in the files <code>heap.c</code> under <code>src</code> and <code>heap.h</code> under <code>include</code>. The <code>heap.h</code>file also contains quite a bit of commentary showing the choices I was contemplating there.</p>
<p>A type called <code>VALUE</code> is defined in <code>typedefs.h</code> and represents values that make sense in the lisp computation. <code>VALUE</code> is really just a 32Bit unsigned integer. I mention <code>VALUE</code> here as it is frequently used throughout. Another type that is quite frequently in use is <code>UINT</code> which is the same size as <code>VALUE</code> but does not necessarily make sence in the lisp world. <code>UINT</code> is used when it is important that the size matches that of a <code>VALUE</code>. Maybe because it will be turned into a <code>VALUE</code>. When it does not matter if a type matches in size with <code>VALUE</code>, I use <code>int</code> or <code>bool</code> or whatever is needed. This is the case when data that is used only internally in the runtime system. I am not very strict on conventions and will at some point try to take a pass over all code and make it a bit more aligned in that sense.</p>
<p>Within the lispBM runtime system a cons cell is represented by the struct:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
  VALUE car;
  VALUE cdr;
} cons_t;
</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>VALUE</code> and <code>UINT</code> are defined as:</p>
<pre><code>typedef uint32_t VALUE;
</code></pre>
<p>As an example a heap of 1024 cons cells is allocated as follows</p>
<pre><code>cons_t *heap = (cons_t *)malloc(1024 * sizeof(cons_t));
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>VALUE</code> type is a 32bit word used to store: symbols (these are special values that represent variables, pieces of syntax and many other things), signed and unsigned integers and characters. The <code>VALUE</code> type is also large enough to hold a pointer within the heap used to set up linked datastructures. But there is also a lot of bookkeeping that needs to be tracked within the 32bit word (an alternative would be to use additional fields within the <code>cons_t</code> structure for this information. This would mean that the whole 32bit word is usable to store data, but it would increase the memory footprint of the heap.).</p>
<p>The information that is kept within the 32bits of a <code>VALUE</code> is:</p>
<ol>
<li>one mark-bit for the <em>Garbage Collector</em> (explained in a later section).</li>
<li>one bit that differentiates between pointers and values.</li>
<li>In the case of a value, an additional 2 further bits are used to encode the type of that value.</li>
<li>In the case of a pointer, there are several bits that are unused. This is because the heap is <em>small</em> (from kilobytes on the small MCUs up to 64MB on the Zynq) and to represent these <em>offsets</em> not that many bits are needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>The binary representation of a pointer stored in either the <code>car</code> or the <code>cdr</code> has the following shape:</p>
<pre><code>Bit pos: 31 30 29 28 27 26                               2 1 0
Bit val: 0  0  0  0  0  0  XX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX X 0 0 0
</code></pre>
<p>Since the value of the pointer, made up by the Xed out bits above, is only meant to reference other cons cells (which are 8 bytes apart in the allocated heap) the bottom three bits are unused. The zero in position 0 is used to differentiate between pointer and value, thus all pointers will have a zero there and all values will have a one. Bit position 1 is used for the Garbage Collectors mark-bit but only in the <code>car</code> position, in the <code>cdr</code> this bit is unused. Bit position 2 is unused. Depending on how large the heap is there is some number of bits unused on the most significant side as well. The example shows the bits used for a 64MB heap.</p>
<p>For a value there are 28 bits left. Bit 0 and 1 work exactly as in the case above for pointers. That is, bit 0 and 1 are used to differentiation with a pointer and garbage collection. Bits 2 and 3 are used to encode 4 different <em>types</em> of values.</p>
<p>The different types of values are:</p>
<ol>
<li>symbols.</li>
<li>28Bit integer.</li>
<li>28Bit unsigned integer.</li>
<li>Character.</li>
</ol>
<p>That was a lot of text about values for a section about the heap. But these two concepts are pretty tightly linked as all that extra runtime information bookkeeping has to go in there and be available to for example the garbage collector.</p>
<p>After allocating the heap, the next step is to link all the cons cells that it consists of into a single, long, linked list called the <code>free_list</code>.</p>
<p>When a program is requesting a fresh cons cell, for example from a usage of the <code>cons</code> function, the head (car) of the <code>free_list</code> is provided. The <code>free_list</code> variable is then set to the cdr of itself. This operation is performed by the function <code>heap_allocate_cell</code> in file <code>heap.c</code>. If there are no free cells on the <code>free_list</code> the heap allocation returns a symbol indicating out of heap. This will trigger the evaluator to perform a round of garbage collection.</p>
<p><img src="./media/heap_allocate_cell.png" title="Heap allocate cell" alt="Heap allocate cell" /></p>
<h2 id="symbols">Symbols</h2>
<p>Symbols are represented by text strings in source (or in what you enter into the REPL). So for example if the line <code>(define accumulator 0)</code> is entered into the REPL, <code>accumulator</code> is a symbol. The word <code>define</code> is actually also a symbol.</p>
<p>But as we have seen symbols can live on the heap. This means that the string of text that is the symbol in the source code must be turned into something that can be stored in a <code>VALUE</code>.</p>
<p>In lispBM the files <code>symrepr.h</code> and <code>symrepr.c</code> takes care of this conversion from text strings to integer values. It is also important that the backwards mapping from the integer value to the text string is maintained so that the string representation can be presented to the user of the REPL rather than just some obscure number. There are currently two different implementations maintaining this mapping of symbols as integers to symbols as string and the other way around. One implementation based on a hash-table and one based on a linked-list. The hash-table implementation has a larger memory footprint but should allow for faster lookups while the linked-list implementation uses memory proportional to the number of symbols that have been introduced. When using lispBM on, for example, an STM32 with less memory the linked-list implementation is used.</p>
<p>Symbols are stored on the heap and thus they must fit into a <code>VALUE</code>. This means there are only 28Bits are available to represent different symbols since there are 4Bits that represent type and used by garbage colletor and so on (28 bits should be plenty enough though!.).</p>
<p>Using the hash-table or the linked-list the conversion process is very similar.</p>
<p>The string representaion of a symbol is hashed into a 16Bit value. Actually a value between <code>0</code> and <code>0xFFFE</code>. This means that there can be collisions where 2 different symbols have the same 16Bit id. Collisions resolved by each bucket of the hash-table (or each element of the linked-list) contain a linked-list of length at most 4096. So if two values collide and have the same 16Bit id, they will get an additional 12Bits of id that depends upon how deeply within the (bucket) linked list they are.</p>
<pre><code>UINT hash_string(char *str, UINT modulo) {

  UINT r = 1;
  size_t n = strlen(str);

  for (UINT i = 0; i &lt; n; i ++) {
    UINT sp = small_primes[i % SMALL_PRIMES];
    UINT v = (UINT)str[i];
    r = (r + (sp * v)) % modulo;
  }

  return r;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>hash_string</code> function is called with a <code>modulo</code> of <code>0xFFFF</code> which means that the return value can never be <code>0xFFFF</code>. This frees up 4096 symbols that it is impossible to <strong>create</strong> from a source string entered by the lispBM programmer. These 4096 symbols are treated specially in the implementation for things like signaling errors and for symbols that are present by default (such as <code>nil</code> and <code>define</code>).</p>
<h2 id="environments">Environments</h2>
<p>Environments store mappings between symbols and expressions. In lispBM enviroments are implemented as lists made from cons cells on the heap. The files <code>env.c</code> and <code>env.h</code> contains five functions used to manipulate environments.</p>
<pre><code>VALUE env_set(VALUE env, VALUE key, VALUE val);
VALUE env_lookup(VALUE sym, VALUE env);
VALUE env_copy_shallow(VALUE env);
VALUE env_modify_binding(VALUE env, VALUE key, VALUE val);
VALUE env_build_params_args(VALUE params, VALUE args, VALUE env0);
</code></pre>
<p>The function <code>env_set</code> adds a key-value pair to an environment. However, if the key-value binding already exists in the environment then this existing binding is updated instead.</p>
<p>Looking up in the environment is done using the <code>env_lookup</code> function. This function loops over the cons cells that make up the environment and if a key-value pair matches the key provided, the value part is returned. If no binding that matches is found, a special symbol called error_not_found is returned.</p>
<p>The <code>env_set</code> and the <code>env_lookup</code> functions are used by the evaluator to implement the the funcion <code>define</code> and for looking up what variables are bound to as in <code>(+ a b). The rest of the functions, </code>env_copy_shallow<code>, </code>env_modify_binding<code>and</code>env_build_params_args<code>have more specific use cases related to</code>let<code>and</code>closure` and applications that will be pointed out in the section about evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2>
<p>The Current parser, contained in files <code>tokpar.c</code> and <code>tokpar.h</code>. This code is a bit of a quick hack but seems to work in practice. Earlier the MPC library (Parser combinators for C) was used but showed to be too memory hungry for my liking. And before finding MPC I looked briefly at more traditional parser generators such as <img src="https://bnfc.digitalgrammars.com/" alt="BNFC" />, <img src="https://github.com/westes/flex" alt="Flex" /> and <img src="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/" alt="Bison" />. But the C code generated from these setups seemed clunky and obscure. I did not really know how to port that code over to an embedded platform. Maybe parser generators specifically for embedded platforms should be a thing? These should generate code with an absolute minimal set of dependencies and they could even require the user of them to implemnet a small interfacing layer that provides the functionality needed in terms of the operations available in the HAL used. Such generated parser should also use as little memory as possible and maybe be ok with operating in a small (fixed size) memory area provided as an argument from the user.</p>
<p>The parser in lispBm operates on an abstracted character stream that provides four operations: <code>more</code>, <code>get</code>, <code>peek</code> and <code>drop</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>more</code> checks if there are elements left in the character stream and returns a boolean.</li>
<li><code>get</code> returns the character at the head of the character stream and removes it from the stream.</li>
<li><code>peek</code> takes an integer offset and returns a character found at the point in the stream (counted from the head of the stream).</li>
<li><code>drop</code> removes N characters from the stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason it is abstracted like this is that lispBM can read both plain strings of ascii characters as well as a compressed stream of characters. In the case of reading a compressed stream this approach with an arbitrary <code>peek</code> will result in the stream being decoded multiple times, trading compute resources for memory usage.</p>
