{"body":"# Projects\r\n\r\n## arbb-vm \r\nArBB virtual machine bindings are available [here](http://github.com/svenssonjoel/arbb-vm)\r\n\r\n## EmbArBB\r\n[EmbArBB](http://svenssonjoel.github.com/EmbArBB) is a language for data parallel programming embedded in Haskell. This project implements a higher-level interface to ArBB compared to the arbb-vm bindings above (arbb-vm is used in the backend of this implementation). \r\n\r\n## RayCast\r\nA retro style raycasting graphics engine (like in the first wolfenstein3D game) implemented in Haskell and C. I hope to make a dungeon exploration game (in the style of Eye of the Beholder) using this graphics engine at some time.\r\n\r\n![rayscreens](http://svenssonjoel.github.com/rayscreens.jpg)\r\n\r\nAt first the code was much influenced by the book \"Gardens of Imagination\" but digressed quite a bit after a while. [repository](http://github.com/svenssonjoel/RayCast)\r\n\r\n## Obsidian\r\nObsidian is a GPGPU programming language embedded in Haskell. Three different versions are available on github. For more information about Obsidian see my work [webpage](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~joels)\r\n\r\n### GCDObsidian \r\nThe latest version that also implements Push-Arrays in the Obisidan setting. \r\n\r\n### ArrowObsidian\r\nObsidian with an Arrow-like interface.\r\n\r\n### MonadObsidian\r\nSimilar to ArrowObsidian but with a monad based interface.","name":"Svenssonjoel.github.com","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
