    My webpages use some scripts from third party vendors. For
    example, I use Google analytics to get an idea what kind of content
    is appreciated.

    These scripts from third party vendors may store and access
    cookies on your computer and may use that information for ad
    personalization.

    The following third party services are used on my webpages:
    <ul>
      <li> Google analytics.
      <li> Google custom search.
      <li> Google AdSense ads.
      <li> Youtube links. 
    </ul> 
      
    The youtube links themselves do not store or read cookies, but
    following them to youtube will surely mean that some information
    of that nature is exchanged.

    The services mentioned above are all provided by google and you
    can set your preferences in relation to ad personalization by
    visiting this page, <a href=https://adssettings.google.com> ad
